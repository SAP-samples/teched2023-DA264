# DA264 - Cross-Cloud Modeling with SAP Datasphere and Hyperscaler Data Sources

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called DA264 - Cross-Cloud Modeling with SAP Datasphere and Hyperscaler Data Sources. 

## Overview

Data on multiple scattered source systems (external and SAP) make analysis of category performance difficult. The inability and the high cost of bringing data sources together make root cause analysis of online sales a burdensome process.

This session introduces attendees the Unified data federation architecture allows customers to combine external data sources (Google Analytics and Google BigQuery) with SAP data sources for live category analysis without business data replication and with state-of-the-art performance in one central location.

You are going to analyze Category Performance for digital/online sales by combining external source systems like Google Analytics and sales, discounts and stock data from SAP System.
With a data federation architecture, it is possible to leave data in its source system and access it in one location without replication. With this Hand-on session you can combine their Big Query and SAP data to derive new insights 

## Requirements/ Existing Setup

The requirements/ Existing SetUp to follow the exercises in this repository are:

1) SAP Datasphere Instance already available and configured with spaces and users to explore the provided data model
2) SAP Analytics Cloud already setup and configured for analyzing and visualizing the order fill percentage.
3) You will work with a sample Databricks dataset. To analyze and compare the shipped units with respect to the total units ordered in the sales orders, we will be using the shipment and delivery data from Databricks delta lake which is federated and combined with customer and sales order master data from SAP systems into a unified model used for efficient using SAP Datasphere and SAP Analytics cloud for real-time analytics.Â 
4) In the "Connections" section of SAP Datasphere we already created live connectivity to AWS Databricks and have already running DP Agent on a separate machine for real-time data. This connection is used in the Hands-on session to create data views on remote tables from AWS Databricks.
