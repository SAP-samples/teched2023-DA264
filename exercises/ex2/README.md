# Exercise 2 - Create a Category Management Dashboard on SAP Analytics Cloud

This exercise will focus on leveraging previously created views to create rich Category Management reports in SAP Analytics Cloud. By integrating these data sources, the reports will allow for powerful data analysis and visualization of the sales performance of different product categories. The information gathered from these reports can be used to make informed decisions about product assortment, pricing, and promotions. The use of Big Query and SAP source systems will ensure that the data used in these reports is accurate, up-to-date, and consistent, providing a solid foundation for effective Category Management decision-making.

## Exercise 2.6 Creating **Input Controls** for the dashboard

The challenge is to create "Input Controls" for the dashboard to filter the data displayed on the dashboard. Input Controls allow users to interact with the dashboard and dynamically change the data displayed based on their preferences.

To complete this challenge, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the appropriate fields to be used for filtering, such as "Product Category", "Product Variant", "Country" and "Date".
2. Choose the appropriate type of input controls, such as a drop-down list, a radio button, or a date range selector.
3. Configure the input controls to interact with the dashboard's data sources. This can be done by mapping the input control to the appropriate fields in the data source.
4. Set up the input control to provide options to the users to filter the data. For example, if the input control is a date range selector, the user should be able to select a specific range of dates to view.


Your objective is to create input controls that allow users to filter the data displayed on the dashboard based on their preferences, such as selecting a specific product category or country. The input controls should be intuitive and easy to use, and should be designed to enhance the user's experience and facilitate their decision-making process. Best of luck!

![Input Control](images/inputcontrol2.png)

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

Finally, after having the charts, you can add some input controls to filter the data displayed on the dashboard 

1. ðŸ‘‰ Drag and drop from the left panel **Input Control** widget into the top container

   ![SAC Chart](images/inputcontrol.png)

2. Choose the **DATE** as a dimension and give a fixed range for the filter

   ![SAC Chart](images/daterange.png)

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to create three other **Input Controls**
   
   - Input control for filtering the **Country**
   - Input control for filtering the **Product Category**
   - Input control for filtering the **Product Variant**

   ![SAC Chart](images/ic_all.png)

    After defining those filters you can filter the dashboard by country, time, product category, and product variant. This allows for deeper insights into the data by allowing you to view specific subsets of information based on your needs.

4. Save the **Story** e.g. with a name "TECHED_\<USER_NO>"
